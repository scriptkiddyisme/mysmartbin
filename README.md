# mysmartbin

The application is called SmartBin. The purpose of this application is to allow easier management of bins around the country. For this case, the targeted end user of this application will be the government. This application is meant as a one stop interface which provides real-time and historical data of bins around Singapore using sensors, which will provide information such as bin fullness and location to enable garbage collectors to know when certain bins around Singapore are full so they can clear. This would allow the government and the garbage collectors to be more efficient in their job and reduce overhead of driving around and constantly checking empty bins.

For guide, please refer to MySmartBin-Guide.pdf.
